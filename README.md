# ChatGPT Enter Key Remap

A simple, lightweight Chrome extension that modifies ChatGPT’s keyboard behavior:  
- Enter → inserts a newline
- Ctrl+Enter → sends the message

This extension exists for people who prefer natural text editing in ChatGPT without accidentally sending half-written messages.

## 🛠️ How It Works
This extension injects a small, safe content script into ChatGPT pages:  
It listens for key events inside ChatGPT’s text editor  
It prevents the default send-on-Enter behavior  
It manually inserts a newline when Enter is pressed  
It triggers the normal send function when Ctrl+Enter is pressed  
All logic runs locally in your browser — nothing is uploaded or transmitted.

## 🔐 Permissions
The extension uses only one permission:  
https://chatgpt.com/*  
This is required so the script can run on ChatGPT’s message editor.  
The extension is deliberately restricted to this domain so that it:  
- Does not run on any other website
- Does not modify any other input fields
- Does not affect your browsing experience elsewhere
